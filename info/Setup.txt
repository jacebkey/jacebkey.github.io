(Installation) 
There are not any binaries/applications/libraries that you need to install to view or demo this project, the only the requirement 
is that you have a Web Browser Installed (IE, Firefox, Google Chrome) We recommend using Google Chrome :)

(Setup) 
There are three ways you can view/demo the project:

1. Provided you are either on the TAMU campus network or on the TAMU VPN, you can click this link to access the project:
(projects.cse.tamu.edu/ASCD/Project_1_SL/page.html)

2. If you would like to render the project locally on your own browser, you can simply unzip the contents of the archive, and double-click
on the "index.html" file in order to render the project in your default browser.

3. Alternatively, you can view a YouTube video we created showcasing and demonstrating all aspects of the project by accessing this link:

Documentation for the project can be found in the "docs" folder by opening the "index.html" file or by accessing it through the project webpage

Thank you and have fun!
